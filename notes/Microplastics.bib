	abstract = {Microplastic presence in benthic marine systems is a widely discussed topic. The influence of the natural matrix on microplastic distribution within the sedimentary matrix is often overlooked. Marine sediments from the western inner Oslofjord, Norway, were investigated for temporal trends, with a particular focus on the rela­ tionship between sediment grain-sizes and microplastic distribution. Density separation, optical microscopy and chemical validation were used to categorize microplastics. Microplastic concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 1.71 MPs g − 1 dry weight (dw). Fibres were the most common (76\%), followed by fragments and films (18\%, 6\%). Common polymers were polyesters (50\%), polypropylene (18\%), polymethylmethacrylate (9\%), rayon and viscose (5\%) and elastane (4\%). Microplastics appear to accumulate preferentially according to their morphology and polymer type in certain sediment grain-sizes. Microplastics inputs to the Oslofjord appear to derive from a wastewater treatment plant in the vicinity. Although, the redistribution of microplastics within the fjord needs further investigation.},

	abstract = {Recent estimates suggest that roughly 100 times more plastic litter enters the sea than is found ﬂoating at the sea surface, despite the buoyancy and durability of many plastic polymers. Biofouling by marine biota is one possible mechanism responsible for this discrepancy. Microplastics ({\textless}5 mm in diameter) are more scarce than larger size classes, which makes sense because fouling is a function of surface area whereas buoyancy is a function of volume; the smaller an object, the greater its relative surface area. We tested whether plastic items with high surface area to volume ratios sank more rapidly by submerging 15 different sizes of polyethylene samples in False Bay, South Africa, for 12 weeks to determine the time required for samples to sink. All samples became sufﬁciently fouled to sink within the study period, but small samples lost buoyancy much faster than larger ones. There was a direct relationship between sample volume (buoyancy) and the time to attain a 50\% probability of sinking, which ranged from 17 to 66 days of exposure. Our results provide the ﬁrst estimates of the longevity of different sizes of plastic debris at the ocean surface. Further research is required to determine how fouling rates differ on free ﬂoating debris in different regions and in different types of marine environments. Such estimates could be used to improve model predictions of the distribution and abundance of ﬂoating plastic debris globally.},

	abstract = {Microplastic pollution is omnipresent in biota around the globe, and concerns are rising that humans are exposed to microplastics (MP) through food. Investigations of MP in wild animals relevant for human consumption and the effects in exposed birds and mammals is warranted. We investigated the concentrations of MP in organs and tissues of ﬁsh, seabirds, terrestrial and marine mammals from a plastic polluted area near Bergen, Norway. A standardized autopsy included evaluation of condition, bacteriological and histopathological analyzes. Tissues were analyzed for MP ({\textgreater}10 µm) by pyrolysis Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (py-GCMS) and inspected by polarized light microscopy. We analyzed samples of stomach and intestinal wall, liver and muscle/ﬁllet from three ﬂounders, three cod, three seabirds, three otters and one seal, kidneys from seabirds, otters and the seal, and gills from the ﬁshes. No large plastic items were observed in the gastrointestinal tracts. Eight of 13 animals had MP in one or several tissues. MP was found in intestine (5), stomach (4), liver (3), muscle (3). No MP was found in the seal, and only in the stomach wall of one otter. In seabirds, MP was found in the intestine, stomach and liver, but not muscle. The highest concentration was 3.4 µg/g wet weight in cod liver. Three of the nine investigated polymers were found above the Limit of Quantiﬁcation (LOQ): Polyvinylchloride{\textgreater}polystyrene{\textgreater}{\textgreater}polyethylene terephthalate. MP was quantiﬁed in one of four replicates of cod muscle and one of two replicates of cod liver. No MP was observed by microscopy. The results show levels under or close to the current LOQ. Replicates indicate uneven MP distribution in tissues and resulted in higher prevalence of MP for cod. No adverse effects could be related to MP. The sample size was small, and conclusions cannot be drawn regarding effects or risks. The animals were by-catch, and mostly in good condition when caught. Procedural blanks and air-controls showed very low MP, and support that the MP come from environmental sources. Further studies are needed to determine levels of microplastic in edible tissues and the current wildlife exposure through the food web.},

However, rare information on co-occurrence of microplastics and ARGs in coastal recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is available. This study performed ﬁeld sampling and laboratory analysis to investigate the distribution of microplastics and ARGs in a typical RAS farm. The results showed that microplastics were detected in all water samples with the abundances ranging from 58 to 72 items/m3. Absolute abundances of total 10 ARGs in water samples ranged from 3.24 × 105 to 7.83 × 105 copies/mL while those on microplastic samples were in the range of 1.59 × 109-1.83 × 109 copies/g. Microbial communities of microplastics and water showed signiﬁcant diﬀerence at both phylum and genus levels. Microbial community diversity of microplastics was higher than that of water. ARGs including tetG, qnrS, sul1, sul2, and ermF possessed relatively more active relationships with bacterial community in water and on microplastics of the RAS farm. The results suggested that microplastics might be an important reservoir of ARGs in RAS farms. The ﬁndings of this study will provide useful information on pollution control and environmental management for both microplastics and ARGs in coastal aquaculture systems.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the transport of plastic debris from river to sea is crucial for assessing the risks of plastic debris to human health and the environment. We present a global modelling approach to analyse the composition and quantity of point-source microplastic ﬂuxes from European rivers to the sea. The model accounts for different types and sources of microplastics entering river systems via point sources. We combine information on these sources with information on sewage management and plastic retention during river transport for the largest European rivers. Sources of microplastics include personal care products, laundry, household dust and tyre and road wear particles (TRWP). Most of the modelled microplastics exported by rivers to seas are synthetic polymers from TRWP (42\%) and plastic-based textiles abraded during laundry (29\%). Smaller sources are synthetic polymers and plastic ﬁbres in household dust (19\%) and microbeads in personal care products (10\%). Microplastic export differs largely among European rivers, as a result of differences in socio-economic development and technological status of sewage treatment facilities. About two-thirds of the microplastics modelled in this study ﬂow into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. This can be explained by the relatively low microplastic removal efﬁciency of sewage treatment plants in the river basins draining into these two seas. Sewage treatment is generally more efﬁcient in river basins draining into the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. We use our model to explore future trends up to the year 2050. Our scenarios indicate that in the future river export of microplastics may increase in some river basins, but decrease in others. Remarkably, for many basins we calculate a reduction in river export of microplastics from point-sources, mainly due to an anticipated improvement in sewage treatment.},

	abstract = {Microplastic debris ending up at the sea surface has become a known major environmental issue. However, how microplastic particles move and when they sink in the ocean remains largely unknown. Here, we model microplastic subject to biofouling (algal growth on a substrate) to estimate sinking timescales and the time to reach the depth where particles stop sinking. We combine NEMOMEDUSA 2.0 output, that represents hydrodynamic and biological properties of seawater, with a particletracking framework. Different sizes and densities of particles (for different types of plastic) are simulated, showing that the global distribution of sinking timescales is largely size-dependent as opposed to densitydependent. The smallest particles we simulate (0.1 μm) start sinking almost immediately around the globe and their trajectories take the longest time to reach their first sinking depth (relative to larger particles). In oligotrophic subtropical gyres with low algal concentrations, particles between 1 and 0.01 mm do not sink within the simulation time of 90 days. This suggests that in addition to the comparatively well-known physical processes, biological processes might also contribute to the accumulation of floating plastic (of 1–0.01 mm) in subtropical gyres. Particles of 1 μm in the gyres start sinking largely due to vertical advection, whereas in the equatorial Pacific they are more dependent on biofouling. The qualitative impacts of seasonality on sinking timescales are small, however, localized sooner sinking due to spring algal blooms is seen. This study maps processes that affect the sinking of virtual microplastic globally, which could ultimately impact the ocean plastic budget.},

It has been shown that water resources and marine food consumers are adversely affected by microplastics due to their physico-chemical characteristics. This study attempts to comprehensively review the structure of four well-known Lagrangian particle-tracking models, i.e., Delft3D—Water Quality Particle tracking module (D-WAQ PART), Ichthyoplankton (Ichthyop), Track Marine Plastic Debris (TrackMPD), and Canadian Microplastic Simulation (CaMPSim-3D) in simulating the fate and transport of microplastics. Accordingly, the structure of each model is investigated with respect to addressing the involved physical transport processes (including advection, diffusion, windage, beaching, and washing-off) and transformation processes (particularly biofouling and degradation) that play key roles in microplastics’ behavior in the marine environment. In addition, the effects of the physical properties (mainly size, diameter, and shape) of microplastics on their fate and trajectories are reviewed. The models’ capabilities and shortcomings in the simulation of microplastics are also discussed. The present review sheds light on some aspects of microplastics’ behavior in water that were not properly addressed in particle-tracking models, such as homo- and hetero-aggregation, agglomeration, photodegradation, and chemical and biological degradation as well as additional advection due to wave-induced drift. This study can be regarded as a reliable steppingstone for the future modiﬁcation of the reviewed models.},

Although there are reviews regarding microplastic debris in environments, most of them focus on the studies on their type, occurrence, and distribution. Only a limited number of these studies focus on the modeling methods, usually concentrating on particular aspects, such as settling or bio­ accumulation. In this paper, physically-based existing microplastics modeling studies are classified and reviewed according to the environment, modeling methodology, and input-output relationships. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of all modeling methodologies, it is deduced that more reliable results are obtained using hybrid methods, especially the coupling of hydrodynamic and process-based models, and hydrodynamics and statistical models. The significance of having much more consideration and knowledge on the microplastics’ physical properties and the environmental processes affecting their fate and transport in the aquatic environments is revealed for future research. It has also been recommended that a standardized method for data calibration, validation, and verification is necessary to be able to compare the modeling results with field investigations more efficiently than it is currently.},

We hypothesize that seasonal production and degradation of organic matter, and corresponding changes in the plankton ecosystem affect the MP capacity for transportation and burying in sediments in different seasons. This is simulated with a coupled hydrodynamical-biogeochemical model that provides a baseline scenario of the seasonal changes in the planktonic ecosystem and changes in the availability of particulate and dissolved organic matter. In this work, we use a biogeochemical model OxyDep that simulates seasonal changes of phytoplankton (PHY), zooplankton (HET), dissolved organic matter (DOM) and detritus (POM). A speciﬁcally designed MP module considers MP particles as free particles (MPf ree), particles with biofouling (MPbio f ), particles consumed by zooplankton (MPhet) and particles in detritus, including fecal pellets (MPdet). A 2D coupled benthic-pelagic vertical transport model 2DBP was applied to study the effect of seasonality on lateral transport of MP and its burying in the sediments. OxyDep and MP modules were coupled with 2DBP using Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Modelling (FABM). A depletion of MP from the surface water and acceleration of MP burying in summer period compared to the winter was simulated numerically. The calculations conﬁrm the observations that the “biological pump” can be one of the important drivers controlling the quantity and the distribution of MP in the water column.},

	abstract = {Microplastic (MP) contamination is ubiquitous in the environment and many species worldwide have been shown to contain MP. The ecological impact of MP pollution is still unknown, thus there is an urgent need for more knowledge. One key task is to identify species suitable as sentinels for monitoring in key eco-compartments, such as coastal waters. In Norway, mussels (Mytilus spp.) have been monitored for hazardous contaminants through OSPAR since 1981. Norway has the longest coastline in Europe and adding MP to the Norwegian Mussel Watch is therefore important in a European and global context. The present study reports MP data in mussels (332 specimens) collected from multiple sites (n ¼ 15) spanning the whole Norwegian coastline. MPs were detected at all locations, except at one site on the west coast. Among the most surprising ﬁndings, mussels from the Barents Sea coastline in the Finnmark region, contained signiﬁcantly more MPs than mussels from most of the southern part of the country, despite the latter sites being located much closer to major urban areas. Only mussels from a site located very close to Oslo, the capital, contained levels similar to those observed in the remote site in Finnmark. In total an average of 1.5 (±2.3) particles indÀ1 and 0.97 (±2.61) particles w.w. gÀ1 was found. The most common MPs were {\textless}1 mm in size, and ﬁbres accounted for 83\% of particles identiﬁed, although there was inter-site variability. Thirteen different polymeric groups were identiﬁed; cellulosic being the most common and black rubbery particles being the second. This study suggests Mytilus spp. are suitable for semi-quantitative and qualitatively monitoring of MPs in coastal waters. However, some uncertainties remain including mussel size as a confounding factor that may inﬂuence ingestion, the role of depuration and other fate related processes, and this call for further research.},

Therefore, consumption of aquatic products is a main primary source of human exposure to microplastics. Recently, aquaculture production has experienced tremendous growth and will exceed production from ﬁsh catch soon. Because they constitute an important source of protein in the human food supply, aquaculture products contaminated with microplastics directly affect food quality and safety. The present review summarizes documented studies regarding the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in various aquaculture systems and species and compares microplastic pollution in aquaculture species and captured species. Microplastics in aquaculture environments mainly come from exogenous imports, such as plastic waste and debris from the land, tourism, shipping transportation and atmospheric deposition. In addition, the use of plastic gear and equipment, aquaculture feed and health products, and special aquaculture environments contribute to a higher accumulation of microplastics. We also discuss the adverse effects of microplastics in aquaculture species and the potential health risks of microplastics to humans through the food chain. In summary, this review highlights the effects of microplastic pollution in aquaculture, particularly the ecological impacts on aquaculture species and associated human health implications, and calls for restricted control of microplastics in aquaculture ecosystems.},

The fate of the missing plastic and its impact on marine life remains largely unknown. To address these unknowns, we irradiated post-consumer microplastics (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene, PP; and expanded polystyrene, EPS), standard PE, and plastic-fragments collected from the surface waters of the North Pacific Gyre under a solar simulator. We report that simulated sunlight can remove plastics from the sea surface. Simulated sunlight also fragmented, oxidized, and altered the color of the irradiated polymers. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is identified as a major byproduct of sunlight-driven plastic photodegradation. Rates of removal depended upon polymer chemistry with EPS degrading more rapidly than PP, and PE being the most photo-resistant polymer studied. The DOC released as most plastics photodegraded was readily utilized by marine bacteria.},

Therefore, sinking experiments were conducted with diverse polymer particles using ﬂuids with different salinity. Particles ranged from 0.3 and 3.6 mm with sinking rates between 6 and 91 × 10−3 ms−1. The sinking velocity was not solely related to particle density, size and ﬂuid density but also to the particles shape leading to considerable deviation from calculated theoretical values. Thus, experimental studies are indispensable to get basic knowledge about the sinking behaviour and to gain representative datasets for model approaches estimating the distribution of microplastics in aquatic systems. The sinking behaviour may be altered considerably by weathering and biofouling demanding further studies with aged and fouled plastic particles. Furthermore, assumptions are made about the inﬂuence of sinking fouled microplastics on the marine carbon pump by transferring organic carbon to deeper water depths.},

However, for the control parameter of the drag coefficient (Cd), no generalized formula has been pro­ posed for MPs of different shapes and materials. In this study, a total of 1343 MP settling data were collected from the literature. It was found that the drag law for perfect spheres cannot reasonably predict Cd for MPs with particle Reynolds number of 1–103. A new formula for Cd was developed by introducing the dimensionless particle diameter (d*) and two shape descriptors. The absolute error of the new formula is 15.2\%, smaller than those (42.5–72.8\%) of other existing formulas. Moreover, an explicit model was developed for MP settling ve­ locity by correlating Cd, d*, and shape descriptors, with lower absolute error (8.8\%) than those (15.4–77.2\%) of existing models.},

            Every year, about four percent of the plastic waste generated worldwide ends up in the ocean. What happens to the plastic there is poorly understood, though a growing body of evidence suggests it is rapidly spreading throughout the global ocean. The mechanisms of this spread are straightforward for buoyant larger plastics that can be accurately modelled using Lagrangian particle models. But the fate of the smallest size fractions (the microplastics) are less straightforward, in part because they can aggregate in sinking marine snow and faecal pellets. This biologically-mediated pathway is suspected to be a primary surface microplastic removal mechanism, but exactly how it might work in the real ocean is unknown. We search the parameter space of a new microplastic model embedded in an earth system model to show that biological uptake can significantly shape global microplastic inventory and distributions and even account for the budgetary “missing” fraction of surface microplastic, despite being an inefficient removal mechanism. While a lack of observational data hampers our ability to choose a set of “best” model parameters, our effort represents a first tool for quantitatively assessing hypotheses for microplastic interaction with ocean biology at the global scale.},

The paper approaches the subject of MPs holistically, emphasises the knowledge gaps and challenges in answering pressing questions, discusses the limitations that so far have prevented these questions from being solved, and suggests approaches for answering them. The Nordic context is chosen due to the global importance of its ecosystem that is threatened by MP pollution, exacerbated by climate change. The research questions discussed pick up knowledge gaps identified in attempts to answer the most pressing questions of our time regarding marine MP pollution and are applicable to some or all seas of the Nordic region, from the Baltic and North Seas in the south to the Arctic in the north. The research questions relate to sources, sinks and transport of MPs, and how food webs are potentially impacted in Nordic marine environments. In addition, we point out the relevance for stakeholders expected to use the emerging knowledge. Through this exercise, using concrete examples, we aim to invite discussions on how a concerted effort by the Nordic countries can bring MP research to a higher level of understanding needed to address the MP pollution problem in Nordic marine habitats.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest size-selective removal of small plastic particles from the ocean surface, an observation that remains unexplained. We studied one of the hypotheses regarding this size-selective removal: the formation of a bioﬁlm on the microplastics (biofouling). We developed the ﬁrst theoretical model that is capable of simulating the eﬀect of biofouling on the fate of microplastic. The model is based on settling, bioﬁlm growth, and ocean depth proﬁles for light, water density, temperature, salinity, and viscosity. Using realistic parameters, the model simulates the vertical transport of small microplastic particles over time, and predicts that the particles either ﬂoat, sink to the ocean ﬂoor, or oscillate vertically, depending on the size and density of the particle. The predicted size-dependent vertical movement of microplastic particles results in a maximum concentration at intermediate depths. Consequently, relatively low abundances of small particles are predicted at the ocean surface, while at the same time these small particles may never reach the ocean ﬂoor. Our results hint at the fate of “lost” plastic in the ocean, and provide a start for predicting risks of exposure to microplastics for potentially vulnerable species living at these depths.},
