# opendrift_bioplast_othercode
A place to put testing and plotting code, as well as the start of a manuscript


### test_tank
This is a sandbox version to get into detail if the code is working; the code needs manually updating to reflect the latest bioplast

### test_cases
These are test cases for the opendrift_bioplast module using different forcing, at the moment constant forcing or the CMEMS IBI data

### notes
Some notes, but I've also started these on overleaf so probably redundant
